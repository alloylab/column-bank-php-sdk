# column-bank-php-sdk

## Installation
composer require alloylab/column-bank-php-sdk

## Objective
This SDK is intended to be used by developers who wish to integrate with the Column Bank API. This SDK is meant to be a simple wrapper around the Column Bank API as documented at https://column.com/docs/api/ \
The query parameters for all endpoints are not verified within this project, it relies on Column Bank to accept or reject the query parameters. The parameters are documented in the doc blocks for each endpoint so they are picked up by IDEs.

## Work in progress
Most of the endpoints have been implemented; however, I am not adding them to the repo until I have tests created.

## Remote Repo

I have no affiliation with Column Bank. I am simply a customer of Column Bank and wanted to implement the API in PHP.
